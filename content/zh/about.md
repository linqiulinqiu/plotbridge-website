After several months of designing, coding, testing, the PlotBridge application has finally brought online on the Binance Smart Chain Mainnet. The website of PlotBridge application is: https://app.plotbridge.net

The PlotBridge can exchange some small offline coins of PoC into BEP20 tokens that could be recognized on the BSC mainnet. The tokens then can be used in many ways on the BSC.

The first coin supported by the bridge is **CHIVES**, you can deposit your XCC(Chives coins) onto the PlotBridge to get PXCC on the BSC, play on the BSC, and then you can withdraw PXCC to XCC from the bridge back to your wallet any time. Further more, you can also buy PXCC on the BSC and exchange to XCC by the bridge and withdraw XCC to your wallet with the help of the bridge.

The bridge will charge only a small fee for the services. The exchange rate of coin to token is 1:1. That is one XCC will be exchanged by the PlotBridge to one PXCC.

After Chives coin (XCC), our team will put out Chia coin (XCH) on the PlotBridge at the end of this week. We'll first test the application on the BSC testnet, then turn to mainnet. The XCH will be exchanged to PXCH on the BSC mainnet. Please wait.

Our team will do our best on the bridge service, and let the bridge be better and better. Please join us, test the bridge, give us any of your feel, suggestion and idea. Thank you for all your support!
