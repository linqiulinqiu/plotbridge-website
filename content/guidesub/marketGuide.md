# How to run MarketPlace

In the marketplace, you can buy NFTs, or you can list your own NFTs for sale. When listing, first click on the NFT you want to sell, choose to send to the market and confirm, after waiting for the completion of sending, you must fill in the selling price, save and confirm, otherwise the sale will be invalid. 

Currently, BNB and BUSD are supported to sell or buy NFTs.

What if you minted an NFT yourself and you are not satisfied? You can click on the dissatisfied NFT in the market, then click on destroy and confirm in the pop-up window, the dissatisfied NFT will be destroyed, and we will automatically send a PBP reward to your wallet. This fund is specially used to reward the destruction of NFTs.
