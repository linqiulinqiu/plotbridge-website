# How to get more XCC?  ~ Use PlotBridge to arbitrage

In general, the best way to get more XCC is to farm (initially, when we didn't have enough disk space to reclaim the Chia plot, but we could reclaim some XCC plots), followed by buying and staking income.

After XCC is converted into WXCC on Binance Smart Chain using PlotBridge, it is traded on the PancakSwap exchange. Different trading methods and attitudes on the chain and off the chain have many opportunities to form short-term trading price differences with other off-chain exchanges.  It provides an opportunity for everyone to arbitrage between exchanges. This is an additional solution that needs to be digested and explored by oneself.
