# How-to Guide: Connecting MetaMask to Binance Smart Chain


## Installing and setting up MetaMask
Start by downloading MetaMask for Chrome, Brave, iOS, and Android.

- Next, create a wallet
- Write down the backup seed phrase somewhere secure (preferably not on an Internet-connected device)
- Without this phrase, your funds can’t be recovered if your device is damaged or lost
- Finally, confirm your seed phrase by following the on-screen instructions

And voila! Your wallet is ready to send, store, and receive tokens.

## Configuring the wallet
You might notice straight away that we’re still dealing with an Ethereum wallet. At best, this won’t work with Binance Smart Chain DApps. At worst, __you could lose funds by sending them to addresses you can’t actually use.__

Let’s change that. We want to access Settings to point the wallet towards Binance Smart Chain nodes.

On the Settings page, navigate to the Networks menu.

Click Add Network in the top-right corner to manually add Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.  

Network Name: Binance Smart Chain  
New RPC URL: `https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/`  
ChainID: 56  
Symbol: BNB  
Block Explorer URL: `https://bscscan.com` 

Once you Save the Network and return to the main view, you’ll notice two things: the network has automatically been set to the one you just entered, and the units are no longer denominated in ETH, but in BNB.
