## Common

#### Q: Why do you choose Binance Smart Chain (BSC)?

A: IMHO, BSC is the second popular smart chain for DeFi application. Ethereum is the most popular chain, but the transaction fee is always so high! So, a balanced choice is BSC. We may also support more smart chain in the future, perhaps MATICS? Do you have a suggestion?

## Usage
